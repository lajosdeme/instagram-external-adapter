# instagram-external-adapter

This extrenal adapter can be used by any [Chainlink](https://chain.link) oracle to download a picture from instagram, upload it to IPFS and send back the content id to the requesting smart contract.

I use this external adapter in my side project [Cryptogram](https://github.com/lajosdeme/Cryptogram) which lets you create a non-fungible ERC-721 token from your Instagram images.  
Check out the [Readme](https://github.com/lajosdeme/Cryptogram/blob/main/README.md) of that project for more info.
